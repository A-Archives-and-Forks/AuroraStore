===========================================================================================================================================================

The Aurora Store is a fork of **YalpStore** by **Sergey Yeriomin** [@yeriomin](https://github.com/yeriomin), all credits to him.

Aurora Store is designed and developed with a motto to provide an alternate to Google's PlayStore, with an elegant design,
using Aurora you can download apps, update existing apps, search for apps, get details about in-app trackers and much more.

You can also Spoof your Device Information, Language and Region to get access to the apps that are not yet available/restricted in/on your Country/Device.

Aurora Store does not require Google's Framework to operate, it works perfectly fine with/without GooglePlatService/MicoG. 
Thereby avoding the various *userdata & privacy issues concerned with Google Play Services.


# Frequently Asked Questions 

* <b>What is the difference between Aurora Store and Google Play Store?</b>

Unlike Google Play Store, Aurora doesn't track your downloads or the apps you use. We respect your privacy. Aurora is also uneffected by Google marking your device as uncertified or a lack of GApps.''

Some people thought we were trying to clickbait by using Samsung's "Galaxy" likeness (False). Because of this we have decided to drop the Galaxy name in place of Aurora.
